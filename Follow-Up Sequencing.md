**DAY 1 (Manual Work \+ Automation)**

**Manual response via email (context dependent but CTA will be \- drafted by AI):**

Sounds good, does {time 1 day 1} or {time 2 day 2} work for you?

**Automated trigger a linkedin connection (on Unipile, 1 hour delay)** 

*“Hi {FIRST\_NAME}, just wanted to connect on here too as well as over email”*

**Trigger an SMS to be sent (from Go High Level, 2 minute delay)**

*“Hi {FIRST\_NAME}, it’s {name} from {company}, I just sent over an email but wanted to drop a text too incase it went to spam \- here’s the link {link}”*

***After they pick a time that works email sent via Airtable***

Great I’ve booked you in and you should get a reminder to your email.

Before the call would you be able to let me know {qualification question 1} and {qualification question 2} just so I’m able to prepare properly for the call.

**DAY 2 (Automated workflows)**

**Workflow Triggered if no response to our meeting suggestion**

***Automated email goes out (via airtable)***

Hi {FIRST\_NAME} could I get the best number to reach you on so we can give you a call?

**Manual action triggered \- If they provide phone number (via Omnichannel Platform \-\> Go High Level)**

Caller double dials \- ask questions and book them in  
Immediate phone call via AI caller is the best play here bc we are top of mind

If no response, SMS asking when is a good time to give them a call

**If no phone number provided**

Check to see whether they have connected on LinkedIn yet \- follow up on there if so

**DAY 5 (Automated workflows)**

**Automated Email 2 of workflow (via airtable)**

Hi {FIRST\_NAME}, just had time to get back to you.

I’m currently reviewing the slots I have left for new clients and just wanted to give you a fair shot in case you were still interested in {achieving result}. 

No problem if not but just let me know. I have {x day x time} and {y day y time} and if it’s easier here’s my calendar link for you to choose a time that works for you: {link}

**Automated Trigger SMS \#2 (via Omni-channel platform/GHL)**
