# Phase 106d — Bug: Meetings booked doesn’t automatically stop workflows/sequences

## Focus
Align this bug with the existing dedicated phase plan and extract the specific implementation steps to stop sequences after booking.

## Inputs
- Monday item: “Meetings booked doesn't automatically stop the workflows/sequences”
- Jam: https://jam.dev/c/aaf7e47d-a3d9-4053-b578-a27e8cafc26c
- Existing plan: `docs/planning/phase-98/plan.md`

## Work
1. Review Phase 98 plan and confirm scope remains accurate.
2. Extract the required code changes and tests from Phase 98.
3. Identify any new regressions since Phase 98 plan was created.
4. Define verification steps for GHL + Calendly flows.

## Output
- A concise execution plan referencing Phase 98 with any new deltas.

## Handoff
Execute Phase 98 plan (or update it) before implementing changes.
