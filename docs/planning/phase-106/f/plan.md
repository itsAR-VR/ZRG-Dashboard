# Phase 106f — Bug: AI keeps asking questions to leads post booking

## Focus
Ensure AI responses after booking are acknowledgment-only and do not ask new qualification questions.

## Inputs
- Monday item: “AI keeps asking questions to leads post booking”
- Jam: https://jam.dev/c/7885b3fa-b274-4ea3-9bc3-3f82fdb6d13e
- Auto-reply gate: `lib/auto-reply-gate.ts`
- Draft generation: `lib/ai-drafts.ts`, `lib/ai/prompt-registry.ts`
- Lead status transitions: booking/webhook logic in `lib/booking.ts`, `app/api/webhooks/*`

## Work
1. Reproduce using Jam details and confirm lead status at the time of response.
2. Verify whether the post-booking response is generated by the AI pipeline or follow-up sequences.
3. Audit prompt logic for “meeting booked”/“yes” paths and enforce acknowledgment-only behavior.
4. Ensure gate logic prevents question-asking when status is `meeting-booked`.
5. Define tests to cover post-booking messaging behavior.

## Output
- Fix plan covering gate + prompt adjustments and verification steps.

## Handoff
Implement and validate with Jam repro and a synthetic lead test.
