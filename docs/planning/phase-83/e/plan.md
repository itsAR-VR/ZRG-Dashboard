# Phase 83e — README Roadmap (Future Features)

## Focus
Document the CRM/pipeline/sales-call vision and explicitly mark which parts are **not yet implemented**, so expectations are clear.

## Inputs
- User requirements from Phase 83 context
- Current `README.md` sections/structure

## Work
- Add a concise roadmap section covering:
  - CRM table in Analytics (Google Sheet replica)
  - Pipeline tracking fields (stage/value/outcome)
  - Sales call recording metadata + coaching fields
  - Future AI optimization loop (learning from close outcomes)
- Clearly mark “skeleton only / coming soon” items.

## Output
- A README update plan (copy blocks + placement), ready for implementation.

## Handoff
Implement README update only after the MVP table schema is merged (so docs match reality).
