# Phase 83e — README Roadmap (Future Features)

## Focus
Document the CRM/pipeline/sales-call vision and explicitly mark which parts are **not yet implemented**, so expectations are clear.

## Inputs
- User requirements from Phase 83 context
- Current `README.md` sections/structure

## Work
- Add a concise roadmap section covering:
  - CRM table in Analytics (Google Sheet replica)
  - Pipeline tracking fields (stage/value/outcome)
  - Sales call recording metadata + coaching fields
  - Future AI optimization loop (learning from close outcomes)
- Clearly mark “skeleton only / coming soon” items.

## Output
### README Updated

- Added **Roadmap (Planned / Skeleton-Only Fields)** section outlining:
  - Analytics CRM Sheet replica
  - Pipeline tracking fields (schema-only)
  - Sales call metadata (schema-only)
  - AI optimization loop (future)

**File updated:** `README.md`

## Handoff
Phase 83 execution complete. Proceed to phase wrap-up in the root plan.
