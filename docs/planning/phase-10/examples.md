# Phase 10 — “Not Ready” vs “Not Looking” Regression Examples

Goal: treat **timing deferrals** as `Follow Up` (nurture), and **hard declines** as `Not Interested` (or `Blacklist` for opt-outs).

## Deferral / “Not Now” → `Follow Up`
- “Not ready to sell yet — maybe next year.”
- “We might consider selling in a couple of years.”
- “Not looking to sell right now.”
- “Not right now, but check back in 6 months.”
- “We’re not planning to sell until 2027.”
- “Maybe later. Reach out next quarter.”
- “Could be interested, just not this year.”
- “Not now—need to finish a few projects first.”
- “I’m open to selling eventually, just not at the moment.”
- “Let’s revisit after tax season.”

## Hard No / “Not Looking (Period)” → `Not Interested`
- “Not looking to sell.”
- “We don’t want to sell.”
- “Not interested.”
- “No thanks.”
- “We are not selling the business.”
- “Not a fit.”

## Opt-out / Compliance → `Blacklist`
- “Stop.”
- “Unsubscribe.”
- “Do not contact me again.”
- “Remove me from your list.”

## Draft expectations for `Follow Up` (timeline capture)
Keep it low-pressure; do **not** push a meeting. Ask a single timeline question + permission to check back:
- SMS pattern: “Totally understand — when might you consider selling (6–12 mo, 1–2 yrs, or later)? OK if I check back then?”
- Email pattern: “Thanks — totally understand. What timing would be best (6–12 months, 1–2 years, or later)? If you’re open to it, I can follow up around then.”
