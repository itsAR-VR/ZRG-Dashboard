# Phase 157 - Review

## Summary
- Retroactive Terminus Maximus validation pass completed on 2026-02-17 for Phase 157.
- Plan integrity verified: subphase docs, output/handoff completion, and root-plan objective tracking were audited.
- This review captures current closure state without rewriting prior implementation history.

## Verification
- npm run lint - pass (warnings only)
- npm run typecheck - pass
- npm run build - pass
- npm test - pass
- End-of-turn NTTAN execution is tracked in the active phase (Phase 166) per one-shot directive.

## Phase Integrity Snapshot
- Objective checkboxes: 5/5 complete
- Subphase output/handoff completeness: 7/7 complete
- Root and subphase docs present and readable: yes

## Status
- Current status: complete
- Interpretation:
  - complete = objectives and subphases both closed at doc level.
  - partial = implementation or objective closure still has open items even though subphase artifacts exist.

## Coordination Notes
- Multi-agent dirty worktree validated before this review pass.
- No destructive rewrites were performed; this review is append-only governance evidence for Phase 157.
